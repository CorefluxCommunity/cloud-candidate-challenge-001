# Cloud Backend Challenge

## Goal
- Write a Terraform module using a provider and resource of your choice, but ideally using the DigitalOcean provider. This module must take some variable(s) as input and return some output(s).
- Go HTTP Server: Implement a basic HTTP server using Goâ€™s net/http package.
- Request Handling: The server should map each request path to a specific Terraform module.
- Request Parsing: Design the server to accept JSON input in the HTTP request body and parse it to the Terraform command.
- Return a Response: Once the Terraform apply returns the output, the server should return it as the response.
- Add some auth mechanism to your server and deploy it on the cloud.
- Ensure it uses TLS with an ACME cert.
- Deploy using Terraform
